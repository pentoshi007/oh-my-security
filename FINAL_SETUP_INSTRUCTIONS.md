# Copy the output to CRON_SECRET in .env.local
```

## 🚀 Deployment to Vercel

Once your environment variables are set up:

### 1. **Deploy to Vercel**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (if not already installed)
npm i -g vercel

```

## 🔍 Testing Locally

To test everything works locally:

```bash
# 1. Make sure all environment variables are set in apps/web/.env.local
# 2. Run the development server
npm run dev

# 3. Test the cron endpoint manually (optional)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cron \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET" \
  -H "User-Agent: vercel-cron/1.0"
```
