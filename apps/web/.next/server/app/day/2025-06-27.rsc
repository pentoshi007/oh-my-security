1b:T779,An IoT Botnet refers to a network of interconnected Internet of Things (IoT) devices that have been compromised by malicious actors and are controlled remotely as a group. These devices, which can range from smart home appliances, security cameras, and routers to industrial sensors and medical devices, are often targeted due to their inherent security vulnerabilities, such as weak default credentials, unpatched firmware, and lack of robust security features. Once compromised, these devices become "bots" or "zombies" and are typically used to launch large-scale cyberattacks without the knowledge of their owners. The threat landscape for IoT botnets is rapidly expanding as the number of connected devices proliferates globally, creating a vast and often unsecured attack surface. The importance of understanding this threat cannot be overstated, as IoT botnets possess immense collective power, capable of generating overwhelming traffic for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, violating privacy through surveillance, or consuming vast amounts of network resources. For instance, the recent news highlights how "Zyxel Devices Hit by Active Exploits Targeting CVE-2023-28771 Vulnerability" by a "Mirai-like botnet" on June 23, 2025, demonstrating real-world exploitation of a critical flaw to expand botnet capabilities. The economic impact of IoT botnets is significant, encompassing costs associated with service disruption, incident response, network infrastructure upgrades, and potential regulatory fines. While the "The financial impact of Marks & Spencer and Co-op cyberattacks could reach £440M" as reported by Securityaffairs.com on June 23, 2025, wasn't explicitly an IoT botnet attack, it underscores the massive financial ramifications that large-scale cyber incidents, which botnets frequently enable, can inflict on businesses through operational disruption and reputational damage.1d:Tba3,IoT botnet attacks typically follow a multi-stage process to compromise devices and integrate them into the attacker's network:
1. **Initial Access:** Attackers gain unauthorized entry into IoT devices. This is frequently achieved by:
• **Exploiting known vulnerabilities:** This is a primary method, as seen with the "Mirai-like botnet" actively exploiting "CVE-2023-28771 vulnerability" in Zyxel devices. Attackers scan the internet for devices exposing specific services or firmware versions with known flaws.
• **Brute-forcing weak or default credentials:** Many IoT devices ship with easily guessable default usernames and passwords (e.g., admin/admin, root/12345), or users fail to change them, making them easy targets for automated login attempts.
• **Supply chain compromise:** Malicious code might be injected into a device's firmware or software during manufacturing or distribution.
2. **Persistence:** Once initial access is gained, the attacker installs malicious software, known as a bot client, on the compromised device. This malware is designed to ensure continuous control and often:
• Modifies system settings or startup scripts to run automatically after a reboot.
• Disables legitimate firmware updates or security features to prevent remediation.
• Establishes a persistent communication channel (e.g., C2 server connection) with the attacker's command-and-control infrastructure.
3. **Lateral Movement:** While less common for simple IoT botnets, more sophisticated variants may attempt to scan the internal network of the compromised device (e.g., a home or business network) for other vulnerable IoT devices or even traditional computers, aiming to expand the botnet's reach within that local environment.
4. **Objective Execution:** The compromised devices, now part of the botnet, await commands from the attacker's C2 server. Common objectives include:
• **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks:** The most common use, where thousands or millions of bots simultaneously flood a target server or network with traffic, overwhelming its resources and causing service disruption.
• **Proxying malicious traffic:** Using the compromised devices as relays to anonymize other illicit activities, such as spam campaigns, credential stuffing, or further exploitation attempts.
• **Cryptocurrency mining:** Utilizing the device's processing power to mine cryptocurrencies, though this is less efficient on low-power IoT devices.
• **Data exfiltration:** If the IoT device handles sensitive data (e.g., smart cameras, industrial sensors), the botnet can be used to steal information.
5. **Cleanup (Often Minimal):** Unlike traditional malware, IoT botnet malware often doesn't focus on extensive cleanup. The goal is to remain undetected and persistent. Some variants might attempt to remove logs or disable other malware on the device to maintain exclusive control, but complete removal of traces is rare as persistence is paramount.1f:Ta71,The impact of IoT botnets is multifaceted, affecting various aspects of an organization and individuals:
• **Financial Impact:**
• **Direct Costs:** Significant expenses for incident response, forensic analysis, system remediation, and infrastructure upgrades to prevent future attacks.
• **Revenue Loss:** Businesses targeted by DDoS attacks, a common botnet objective, can experience severe service outages, leading to lost sales, damaged customer trust, and contractual penalties.
• **Reputational Damage:** A breach or service disruption can severely harm a company's brand image, leading to decreased customer loyalty and investor confidence. The large-scale cyberattacks mentioned in the news, such as those impacting Marks & Spencer and Co-op, illustrate the potential for "financial impact [to] reach £440M," highlighting the immense financial risks associated with cyber incidents that botnets can facilitate.
• **Regulatory Fines:** Non-compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) due to privacy violations or data breaches enabled by botnets can result in substantial fines.
• **Operational Impact:**
• **Service Disruption:** Critical services can be brought down or severely degraded by DDoS attacks, impacting essential business operations, customer access, and supply chains.
• **Resource Consumption:** Compromised IoT devices experience degraded performance due to the botnet malware consuming CPU, memory, and network bandwidth, potentially affecting their intended functionality.
• **Network Congestion:** The sheer volume of traffic generated by a botnet can overwhelm internal networks, leading to slowdowns or outages even for legitimate traffic.
• **Security Overhead:** Increased burden on IT and security teams to monitor, detect, and mitigate botnet activity.
• **Strategic/Reputational Impact:**
• **Erosion of Trust:** Widespread IoT botnet attacks can erode public trust in connected devices and the broader IoT ecosystem, potentially slowing adoption or leading to stricter regulations.
• **Brand Damage:** Device manufacturers, like Zyxel, can suffer significant brand damage when their products are identified as vulnerable and actively exploited by botnets, as seen with the "CVE-2023-28771 vulnerability" being targeted by Mirai-like botnets. This can lead to decreased sales and market share.
• **Competitive Disadvantage:** Companies suffering from persistent botnet attacks or associated disruptions may lose their competitive edge.
• **Legal and Compliance Risks:** Increased scrutiny from regulators and potential lawsuits from affected customers or partners due to security failures.21:Tb3d,The primary objective for an attacker orchestrating an IoT botnet is to amass a large, distributed network of compromised Internet of Things (IoT) devices, transforming them into a powerful, controllable, and often anonymous infrastructure. This infrastructure then serves as a platform for various malicious activities, leveraging the collective processing power, network bandwidth, and geographical diversity of the enslaved devices. A key strategic goal is to maximize the number of compromised devices, as this directly correlates with the potency and resilience of the botnet. For instance, the "Mirai-like botnet" actively exploiting CVE-2023-28771 in Zyxel devices, as reported by HackRead, exemplifies this objective. The attackers aimed to compromise as many vulnerable Zyxel devices as possible to expand their botnet's reach and capabilities.
Beyond mere device acquisition, the specific strategic goals often include:
1. **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks:** This is a classic and highly effective use of IoT botnets. By coordinating thousands or millions of compromised devices to simultaneously flood a target's network or services with traffic, attackers can render them unavailable. This aligns with the "Mirai-like" description, as Mirai is infamous for its DDoS capabilities, which could lead to significant financial impact, similar to the £270M–£440M estimated for the M&S and Co-op cyberattacks, if critical services were brought down.
2. **Spam Campaigns:** Botnets can be used to send large volumes of unsolicited emails, overwhelming mail servers and distributing phishing or malware links.
3. **Cryptocurrency Mining (Cryptojacking):** Exploiting the processing power of compromised devices to mine cryptocurrencies, generating illicit revenue for the attacker. While individual IoT devices may have limited processing power, their sheer numbers can make this profitable.
4. **Proxying Malicious Traffic:** Using the compromised devices as proxies to obscure the attacker's true origin, making it difficult to trace malicious activities such as credential stuffing, brute-forcing, or even targeted attacks against other entities.
5. **Data Exfiltration:** In some cases, IoT devices might store sensitive data (e.g., security camera footage, smart home data). Botnets can be leveraged to exfiltrate this data.
6. **Establishing Persistent Command and Control (C2) Infrastructure:** The botnet itself can serve as a resilient C2 network for other, more sophisticated attacks, making it harder for defenders to disrupt.
Ultimately, the overarching objective is to establish a covert, scalable, and resilient platform for offensive operations, maximizing impact while minimizing attribution. The exploitation of vulnerabilities like CVE-2023-28771 highlights the attackers' focus on efficient, widespread compromise to achieve these goals.23:T1353,An IoT botnet attack typically follows a multi-phase methodology, from initial reconnaissance to sustained malicious operations. This process often leverages common IoT device vulnerabilities and insecure configurations.
1. **Reconnaissance and Target Identification:**
• **Device Discovery:** Attackers utilize public search engines for internet-connected devices like Shodan, Censys, or ZoomEye to identify IoT devices exposed to the internet. They search for specific device types (e.g., IP cameras, routers, DVRs, network-attached storage), specific ports (e.g., 23 for Telnet, 80/443 for web interfaces, 22 for SSH), and common IoT device banners.
• **Vulnerability Scanning:** Automated scanners are deployed to probe identified devices for known vulnerabilities. This phase is critical, as demonstrated by the active exploitation of CVE-2023-28771 in Zyxel devices by a Mirai-like botnet. Attackers specifically scan for the presence of this vulnerability (e.g., by sending crafted requests that trigger a vulnerable response or by checking specific firmware versions).
• **Credential Enumeration:** Attackers compile lists of common default usernames and passwords for various IoT manufacturers (e.g., admin:admin, root:root, guest:guest).
2. **Initial Compromise/Exploitation:**
• **Brute-Force/Dictionary Attacks:** The most common method for IoT botnet initial compromise, especially for "Mirai-like" botnets. Automated scripts attempt to log into devices using vast lists of default and weak credentials discovered during reconnaissance. Many IoT devices ship with easily guessable or hardcoded credentials that users rarely change.
• **Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities:** As seen with the Zyxel CVE-2023-28771, attackers actively exploit unpatched vulnerabilities. This involves sending specially crafted network packets or web requests that trigger a remote code execution (RCE) flaw, buffer overflow, or command injection, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device.
• **Web Application Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the device's web administration interface, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or authentication bypasses.
• **Firmware Exploitation:** Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in the device's firmware update mechanism or unauthenticated firmware upload capabilities.
3. **Payload Delivery and Persistence:**
• **Malware Download:** Once initial access is gained (e.g., via RCE or successful login), the attacker downloads and executes a small dropper or the main botnet malware payload onto the compromised device. This payload is typically lightweight and compiled for various IoT architectures (ARM, MIPS, x86, etc.).
• **Persistence Mechanisms:**
• **Init Script/Crontab Modification:** Modifying system startup scripts (e.g., `/etc/init.d/`, `/etc/rc.local`) or adding entries to `crontab` to ensure the malware restarts upon device reboot.
• **Disabling Updates/Firewall:** Attempting to disable legitimate firmware updates or modify firewall rules to prevent detection or removal.
• **Killing Competing Malware:** Many IoT botnet malware variants (like Mirai) scan for and kill processes associated with other botnets to monopolize device resources.
• **Rootkit Installation:** In more advanced scenarios, installing a rootkit to hide the malware's presence and maintain covert access.
4. **Command and Control (C2) Establishment:**
• **C2 Communication:** The compromised device (bot) establishes a persistent communication channel with the attacker's C2 server. Common protocols include IRC, HTTP/S, or custom binary protocols. The C2 server sends commands to the bots, and bots report their status.
• **Decentralized C2:** More resilient botnets might use peer-to-peer (P2P) communication or fast flux DNS techniques to make C2 infrastructure harder to take down.
5. **Action on Objectives / Attack Execution:**
• **DDoS Attacks:** The C2 server instructs the bots to launch a coordinated DDoS attack against a specified target (e.g., SYN flood, UDP flood, HTTP flood). This is the most common use case for "Mirai-like" botnets.
• **Spamming:** Bots are directed to send large volumes of spam emails.
• **Proxying Traffic:** Bots act as SOCKS proxies for other malicious activities.
• **Cryptojacking:** Bots execute cryptocurrency mining software.
• **Data Exfiltration:** If the device contains valuable data, it is exfiltrated to attacker-controlled servers.
6. **Cleanup and Evasion (Optional but Recommended for Red Teams):**
• **Log Deletion:** Removing or modifying system logs (`/var/log/`) to erase traces of the compromise.
• **Process Hiding:** Using techniques to hide the malware process from `ps` or `top` commands.
• **Self-Deletion:** Some malware might attempt to delete itself after execution or if specific conditions are met, though persistence is usually prioritized for botnets.25:T2e50,```python
