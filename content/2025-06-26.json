      "about": "A data breach is the unauthorized access and disclosure of sensitive or confidential data. Attackers use sophisticated methods, and breaches can go undetected for months, leading to high costs and severe regulatory penalties under laws like GDPR and HIPAA.",
      "howItWorks": "Breaches occur through network intrusion, social engineering, insider threats, or exploiting cloud vulnerabilities. Attackers gain access, escalate privileges, and exfiltrate data over long periods to avoid detection.",
      "impact": "Consequences include heavy regulatory fines, legal fees from class-action lawsuits, financial losses from fraud, and significant damage to customer trust and brand reputation, which can take years to rebuild."

      "objectives": "Objectives include financial gain from stolen data (e.g., credit cards), intellectual property theft for corporate espionage, and harvesting personal data for identity theft or sale on the dark web.",
      "methodology": "The attack involves reconnaissance to find targets, exploiting vulnerabilities for initial access, establishing persistence, moving laterally to discover and collect sensitive data, and finally exfiltrating the data covertly.",
